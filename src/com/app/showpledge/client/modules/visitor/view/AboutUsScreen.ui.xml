		<h1>Pledge to purchase your show, per episode direct from the producers!</h1>
		<p>
			We have all had a favorite show that was cancelled. Who cancelled it? The TV network executives. The network
			executives
			decide a show is too expensive, or too complicated so they cancel a show, or stop purchasing episodes. The
			TV
			networks goal is to air inexpensive shows to a large audience. That audience is not you! You like good, in-depth
			programming, with good acting and writing, so why not purchase (and view) episodes of your show directly from the
			producers?
		</p>

		<h2>Save Your Show! How much would you pay per episode?</h2>

		<p>
			Why should the middle man determine what you can watch? The technology has existed for years now to purchase
			episodes of
			your show directly from the producers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your show was cancelled because the networks want a large cut of the profit to decide what you can watch.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is an inefficient model. Why not pay for episodes directly? Eliminate the middle-man.
		</p>
		<h2>How much would you pay per episode for a show?</h2>

		<p>
			ShowPledge is a petition of sorts. How do the producers of a show know if they can continue to make their show? We
			show them with your voting dollars. If enough people pledge to purchase episodes of a show, itâ€™s possible for the
			show to go on.
